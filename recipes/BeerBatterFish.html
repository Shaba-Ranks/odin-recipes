    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>900g white fish eg. hake</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>125 g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1 lightly beaten large egg</li>
        <li>314.67 g beer</li>
        <li>Canola oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a large, heavy bottomed pot or deep fryer till it's about 2 to 3 inches deep. Heat oil to 375
            degrees F.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut fish into stick shapes, about 1 inch wide and 3 inches long. Pat dry with paper towels and
            season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>To make the beer batter, whisk together the flour, garlic powder, paprika and seasoned salt. Stir in the
            lightly beaten egg, then gradually whisk in the beer until the batter forms and is no longer lumpy.</li>
        <li>Quickly dip the fish one piece at a time into the batter, then place in the hot oil. Cook for 3 to 4
            minutes, or until the fish is a nice golden brown. Drain on a wire rack and enjoy while hot!</li>
