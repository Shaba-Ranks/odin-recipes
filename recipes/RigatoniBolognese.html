    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make dinner time quick and easy with this One Pot Rigatoni Bolognese! Everything cooks in one pot – even the

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 cups beef broth or more</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 rigatoni pasta uncooked</li>
        <li>grated parmesan to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><B>Brown the beef:</B> Heat oil in a medium-large pan. Brown the beef, seasoning with a few pinches of salt
            and
            pepper as it cooks.</li>
        <li><B>Cook the vegetables:</B> Add the finely chopped vegetables to the pot with the beef and cook over medium
            heat,
            stirring often, until softened (about 2-3 minutes).</li>
        <li><B>Season and deglaze:</B> Add garlic powder, Italian seasoning, a pinch of salt, pepper and tomato paste to
            the
            pan. Stir until mixed in well. Pour in 3 cups broth, scratching the browned bits off the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li> <B>Cook the pasta:</B> Add the diced tomatoes and uncooked pasta to the skillet, making sure to stir
            everything in
            until the pasta is covered with liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the
            pasta is done, about 15 minutes. Add up to one more cup of broth during cooking, as needed. Serve with
            grated parmesan.</li>
